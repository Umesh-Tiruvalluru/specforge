## Experience

**Software Engineer (Contract)** — AfterQuery _(September 2025 – Present · Remote)_

- Contributing to Project Pluto, developing realistic terminal-based tasks to evaluate frontier LLMs as part of AfterQuery's dataset initiative
- Authored and submitted 3 end-to-end Terminal-Bench tasks, each passing 11/11 validation checks required by the platform
- Designed tasks targeting medium–hard difficulty; observed LLM agent pass rates of 1–4/10, aligning with the project's targeted challenge distribution
- Wrote Python-based test suites using pytest to validate task correctness, edge cases, and deterministic behavior across Linux environments
- Validated reproducibility by pinning dependencies, providing deterministic tests, and preparing Docker-based environments with Oracle and Null agent validations
